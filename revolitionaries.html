        <p class="sam5">
          Mahatma Gandhi pioneered nonviolent resistance, inspiring civil rights movements worldwide.
           His legacy of truth, justice, and peace continues to influence global struggles for freedom and equality.
           Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London and was called to the bar at the age of 22.
            After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian
             merchant in a lawsuit.He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. Here, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign
              for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest
               against discrimination and excessive land tax.Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns
                for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. 
                Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community,

        <p class="sam5">
          Architect of the Indian Constitution and advocate for Dalit rights, Dr. Ambedkar‚Äôs legacy stands as a symbol of equality, education, and social transformation.
          Ambedkar served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru. He later renounced Hinduism, converted to Buddhism and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement.[6]

        After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia University and the London School of Economics,
         receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s.[7] 
         He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities;

        <h1 class="title">The Enduring<br>Legacy of <br>Subhas Chandra Bose</h1>
        <p class="sam5">
          Known for his fearless leadership of the INA, Bose's slogan "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom" continues to inspire patriotic spirit in India.
          The honorific 'Netaji' (Hindustani: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942‚Äîby the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion
           and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.[u][31]

Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj. He received an education oriented towards British standards and was subsequently
 sent to England to take the Indian Civil Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the first exam but chose not to proceed with the standard final examination. Returning to India in 1921,
  Bose joined the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more open to socialism.[

      <h1 class="title">The Enduring<br>Legacy of <br>Lal Bahadur Shastri</h1>
        <p class="sam5">
          Known for his slogan "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan", Shastri promoted self-reliance and integrity during his brief yet impactful tenure as India‚Äôs Prime Minister.
          Shastri was born to Sharad Prasad Srivastava and Ramdulari Devi in Mughalsarai (present-day Uttar Pradesh) on 2 October 1904. He studied in East Central Railway Inter college
           and Harish Chandra High School, which he left to join the non-cooperation movement. He worked for the betterment of the Harijans at Muzaffarpur and dropped his
            caste-derived surname of "Srivastava". Shastri's thoughts were influenced by reading about Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Annie Besant. Deeply impressed and influenced by Gandhi,
             he joined the Indian Independence movement in the 1920s. He served as the president of Servants of the People Society (Lok Sevak Mandal), founded by Lala Lajpat Rai and held prominent
              positions in the Indian National Congress (INC). Following independence in 1947, he joined the Indian government and became one of prime minister Nehru's key cabinet colleagues, first
               as railways minister (1951‚Äì56), and then in numerous other prominent positions, including the home ministry.
